            Following its release, <a href="thispersondoesnotexist.com">thispersondoesnotexist.com</a> inspired a deluge of similar generators. 
            A large portion of them are listed at the aptly named <a href="thisXdoesnotexist.com">thisXdoesnotexist.com</a>.
            The generators here feature varying levels of obscurity. On one end, you have 
            the unsurprising <a href="thiscatdoesnotexist">thiscatdoesnotexist.com</a>, compared to generators such as 
            <a href="thiswaifudoesnotexist.com">thiswaifudoesnotexist.com</a>, which appeal to a much narrower subset of internet users. 
            The generators are not limited to image data, with several having either text or audio capabilities.

            After discovering this collection of generators, I had resolved myself to make my own unique contribution, 
            <a href="thisfrogdoesnotexist.com">thisfrogdoesnotexist.com</a>. However, I was quickly heartbroken 
            when I discovered that github user <a href="https://github.com/bitrate16/thisfrogdoesnotexist">bitrate16</a> 
            had already capitalized on this idea. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately for them), their site, 
            thisfrogodoesnotexist.com is no longer online. With my renewed sense of purpose, I decided to continue on 
            and attempt to reproduce <a href="thisfrogdoesnotexist.com">thisfrogdoesnotexist.com</a>. Before I get into detail on my experiment, I will first briefly 
            explain the technical details.

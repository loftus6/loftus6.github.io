        <h2>This X Does Not Exist</h2>
        
        <p>
            Following it's release, "this person does not exist" inspired a deluge of similar generators. A large portion of them are listed at the aptly named "this X does not exist". 
            The generators here feature varying levels of obscurity. On one end, you have the unsurprising "this cat does not exist". In contrast, generators such as "this waifu does not exist" 
            appeal to a much narrower subset of internet users. The generators are not limited to image data, with several having either text or audio capabilities.

            After discovering this collection of generators, I had resolved myself to make my own unique contribution, "this frog does not exist." 
            However, I was quickly heartbroken when I discovered that github user bitrate16 had already capitalized on this idea. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately for them),
            their site, thisfrogodoesnotexist.com is no longer online. With my renewed sense of purpose, I decided to continue on and attempt to reproduce "this frog does not exist". 
            Before I get into detail on my experiment, I will first explain the technical details in relative brevity.

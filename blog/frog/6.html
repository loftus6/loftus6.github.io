        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        
        <p>
            Like many others, my exploration into generative AI gave me a brief feeling of wonder followed by a 
            stark realization of potential danger. Many of the AI images I have discovered are exceedingly 
            difficult to identify manually, and while AI tools can flag more common examples with reasonable 
            success, they are particularly ineffective against custom trained AI generators such as mine and 
            bitrate16’s frogs. While creating a custom generator requires some technological skills, 
            it is far more accessible than one may realize. All I had to do was download a tool off 
            the internet, set it up, and leave it running for several hours. Although, little damage 
            can be done with a machine that generates fake frogs, that can not be said for thispersondoesnotexist.com. 
            It is possible that AI generated images can be used by malicious parties to gain the trust of individuals 
            targeted for access to protected information, using a technique known as 
            “<a href="https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2020/02/offensive-ai-surfacing-truth-age-digital-fakes/">spear-phishing</a>".

            There is a saying in cybersecurity that your entire operation is only as strong 
            as your weakest link. It only takes one person not using an AI detection tool or the 
            tool failing once for a malicious party to get access. Can we honestly say that
             no one working in critical infrastructure would fall for AI deception? It only takes one person.

        <h2>AI Frogs</h2>

        After approximately 12 hours of training on my laptop, I was able to produce a GAN model 
        that would generate frog images. If one had forgotten to put on their glasses before reading 
        this blog, they would likely be quite impressed with these results. This person would of course 
        be underwhelmed as soon as they did find their glasses. While my model does capture the basic 
        shapes well, closer inspection reveals these creatures to be more reminiscent of lovecraftian 
        horrors than natural frogs. Facial details are almost completely absent and there is a prevalent 
        graininess to the images produced. While I was previously dismayed to find that 
        thisfrogdoesnotexist.com already existed, the opportunity to compare my results with bitrate16â€™s 
        was an appealing silver lining. Fortunately, they had also used the exact same dataset as me, making 
        the comparison straightforward. While their images also have an element of strangeness to them, 
        I consider them to be superior to my own images. This is apparent from the image resolution and 
        finer details such as the presence of facial features. Comparing my results with theirs, 
        I believe that given more training time I would eventually reach a similar level of believability.

        <h2>Explaining StyleGAN</h2>
        
        <p>
            A large portion of these AI generators are built upon the StyleGAN architecture. The main innovation of StyleGAN in layman’s
             terms is the use of “style” formulas, which transform the input data. 
             This text appears to the left of the image.These styles are independent of the input image and can 
             be custom manipulated to produce fine tuned results.

                <img src="/blog/frog/styleganim.png" class="im1", style="    width: 85%; 
                height: auto;"/>
                <figcaption style="font-size: small;">Fig 1: Figure from the paper showcasing style capabilities</figcaption>
             </figure> 
             This also allows for mixing of styles, as demonstrated in the figure below. 
             This style mixing capability is the secret ingredient behindthispersondoesnotexist.com. By combining a large number of facial and 
             stylistic features, StyleGAN produces an uncountable stream of unique faces, which are possessed by no one else, real or fake.

             As mentioned previously, StyleGAN is not limited to just faces. The paper demonstrates successful results for cats, cars, 
             and hotel rooms. I originally set out to reproduce StyleGAN exactly, but I quickly realized that my computer was not nearly 
             powerful enough to run it. As such, I pivoted to use a smaller network as a proof of concept. I settled on using lightweightGAN.

        <h2>This Frog Does Not Exist: A Deep Dive into AI fakes</h2>
        By: Neil Loftus 4/1/2024
        <p>
            In 2019, the website <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com">thispersondoesnotexist.com</a> debuted, instantly making waves. 
            Navigating to the page presents users with an endless stream of realistics faces. True to the name, not a single one of these faces of a real person. 
            Rather, they were all generated by artifical intelligence (AI). The general reaction to this site was a mix of wonder and fear. 
            News outlets reporting on the topic expressed a concern around possible misuse. While in 2019, this was a novel fear, in 2024 with the advent of chatGPT and other
            powerful generative AI applications had made concerns about "deepfakes" and AI misue palpable.

            In this article, I wish to explore thispersondoesnotexist and other sites hosting nonexistant things. I will briefly touch on the technology that makes these tools possible, 
            generative adversarial networks (GANs). Finally, I will attempt to implement my own fake object generator, in the vein of this "person does not exist", which I have deemed thisfrogdoesnot exist.

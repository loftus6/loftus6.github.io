        <h2>This Frog Does Not Exist: A Deep Dive into AI fakes</h2>
        By: Neil Loftus 4/6/2024
        <p>
            In 2019, the website <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com">thispersondoesnotexist.com</a> debuted, instantly making waves. 
            Navigating to the page presents users with an endless stream of realistics faces. True to the name, not a single 
            one of these people are real. Rather, they were all generated by 
            artificial intelligence (AI). The general reaction to this site was a mix of wonder and fear. News outlets reporting on the 
            topic expressed a concern around <a href="https://https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/28/tech/ai-fake-faces/index.html">possible misuse</a>. 
            While in 2019 this was a novel fear, in 2024 the advent of chatGPT and other 
            powerful generative AI applications made concerns about "deepfakes" and AI misuse palpable. Many have advocated for legislation 
            to limit deepfake usage, citing recent stories where deepfakes have been abused 
            for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/war-game-deepfakes-disrupt-2024-election-rcna143038">election disinformation</a> 
            and  <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/deepfake-law-ai-new-jersey-high-school-teen-image-porn-rcna133706">nonconsensual pornography</a>.

            In this article, I wish to explore thispersondoesnotexist.com and other sites hosting non existent things. I will briefly touch on the technology that makes these tools possible, generative adversarial networks (GANs). I also will attempt to implement my own fake object generator, in the vein of this thispersondoesnotexist.com, by recreating the currently unavailable website thisfrogdoesnotexist.com. My goal for doing so is twofold: first, I am interested in AI technology but have done little experimentation with generative AI. Second, I wish to show that these technologies are far more accessible to the average person than one might think. Finally, I will explore safeguards against false AI content and evaluate their efficacy.

        <h2>This Frog Does Not Exist: A Deep Dive into AI fakes</h2>
        
        <p>
            After I had completed my experiment, I wanted to see if AI detectors would flag my frogs as AI generated. 
            These detectors have been the subject of much criticism, especially in regards to 
            <a href="https://themarkup.org/machine-learning/2023/08/14/ai-detection-tools-falsely-accuse-international-students-of-cheating">false plagiarism detections </a>
            because they can erroneously flag human content as AI. I attempted to demonstrate the flaws with 
            this “fighting fire with fire” approach. I chose two AI detection tools to evaluate: 
            <a href="https://aiornot.com">aiornot.com</a> and <a href="https://isitai.com">isitai.com</a>. 
            The first is a limited free trial paid tool while the second is free. For each tool, 
            I submitted several images of fake people and fake frogs. The paid tool was unsurprisingly the 
            better of the two, successfully flagging each AI generated person. When presented with my frog, 
            it could not conclusively decide if it was human or AI. It also believed bitrate16’s frog to be human created.

            The performance of the free detector is far more concerning, as free products are more commonly used. 
            When given four AI generated people, it identified three of them as AI, with one successfully fooling 
            the detector (returning the incorrect result of an 11.5% chance of being AI generated). Both my frog 
            and the frog generated by bitrate16 fooled the detector with less than a 2% chance of being AI generated. 
            While it may be easy to consider the three out of four rate of AI detection a success, it only took me about 
            a minute to find an image which fooled the detector. A dedicated malicious party could easily create an AI 
            generated person which is even harder to detect.

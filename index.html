<p> 
Hello, my name is Neil, and I am an undergraduate at Marshall University. My passions include music, learning, and
Computer Science all of which I have been able to pursue at Marshall University. At my time at Marshall, 
I have been fortunate enough to become actively involved with my department through research and other opportunities.

    <h2>Current Project</h2>
    <h3>CSPCS</h3>
    Since the Fall of 2021, I have been working to create an interactive simulation to teach students about Cybersecurity and Internetworking Concepts. 
    During the Fall and Spring semester of the 2021-22 school year, I worked with my fellow group member Cameron Green and under my mentor
    Dr. Husnu Narman to create this simulation. This simulation is called the "Cyber Security Packet Control Simulator" or "CSPCS". 
    At the end of the 2021-22 school year, we conducted a trial with Computer Science students to gauge the teaching effectiveness 
    of the program, as well as to gather feedback on how to improve the program. Based on the feedback we gathered, I have been 
    working to improve this application with Machine Learning technologies as part of my summer research. Through use of the machine learning
    framework "TensorflowJS", I have been able to make the application use a realistic "command line" system of input, while maintaining
    ease of use through automatic, machine learning based corrections. The original application from the 2021-22 school year
    can be found <a href="https://pws-cspcs.herokuapp.com/">here</a>, and the improved version from summer 2022 can
    be found <a href="https://pws-cspcs-preview.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.

    <h2>Previous Research</h2>
    <p>
        My main areas of research are machine learning (ML) and human computer interaction (HCI). I have worked on multiple projects and
        publications in these fields, and hope to continue in the upcoming years.

Hello, my name is Neil, and I am an undergraduate at Marshall University. My passions include music, learning, and
Computer Science all of which I have been able to pursue at Marshall University. At my time at Marshall, 
I have been fortunate enough to become actively involved with my department through research and other opportunities.

        <h2>An exploration into cinepoetry</h2>

			Prior to this year, I had no familiarity with the term “cinepoem”, and I definitely did not expect that I would be creating them. However, as part of my final honors course at Marshall, I was exposed to the genre through both appreciation and production. Over the past semester, I worked to create 3 distinct cinepoems, and through the feedback of my professor Dr. Nolte and my fellow classmate, I learned several new skills for multimedia production. Prior to this class, I had very sparing video editing experience. I had made a few short edits for classes in high school, with my most involved project being a Covid era school play. Needless to say, I have likely spent as much time video editing this semester as I did in my entire past. I am quite proud of how my editing skills have developed, even if I still have some areas I could improve in, particularly sound design and audio mixing.

I fancy myself a decent writer. As part of my work, I have to write a lot of technical details, and even beyond that, I have been known to venture into essays or creative writing. While it isn’t a public medium, I have written quite a lot as part of fantasy tabletop games I play with my friends, the most well known being Dungeons and Dragons. That being said, I have never considered myself to be a poet. In the past, when given a choice between writing poetry and prose, I would pick prose in a heartbeat, and even when I have been required to write poetry for classes, I often found myself feeling self conscious about it. If I had to hazard a guess as to why, I would say it is due to the personal nature of poetry. When I sit down to write poetry, I find myself criticizing what I want to write more. “Does anyone care? People have much worse problems than me. Am I oversharing?” Unlike with an essay, when I write poetry, I am stepping out from behind the proverbial curtain. I am making a statement about something impactful to me and no matter how much I wrap it up in fanciful language, my true feelings are in there for the reader to dissect. I think my biggest takeaway from this class is that it is okay to write what I want to write, even if it is a personal subject for me. At the end of the day, I chose to write about what I did because it spoke to me. With that being said, I sincerely hope you enjoy these poems.

On the following pages, you will find three cinepoems I made, along with a breakdown of each of them. The first is composed solely of archival footage from the internet archive. The second is a single shot that I captured at my home. The third is a 3D animation I created with Unreal Engine 5. Each of them challenged me to learn something new and to share something about myself, and I hope to continue expressing myself in this way in the future.

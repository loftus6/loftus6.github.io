        <h2>Explaining StyleGAN</h2>
        
        <p>
            A large portion of these AI generators are built upon the StyleGAN architecture. 
            The main innovation of StyleGAN in layman’s terms is the use of “style” formulas, 
            which transform the input data. These styles are independent of the input image and can be custom manipulated 
            to produce fine-tuned results.

            This also allows for mixing of styles, as demonstrated in the figure below. 
            This style mixing capability is the secret ingredient of thispersondoesnotexist.com. 
            By combining a large number of facial and stylistic features, StyleGAN produces a 
            countless stream of unique faces, which are possessed by no one else, real or fake.

            As mentioned previously, StyleGAN is not limited to just faces. 
            Karras’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04948.pdf">paper introducing StyleGAN</a> demonstrates successful results 
            for cats, cars, and hotel rooms. I originally set out to reproduce StyleGAN 
            exactly, but I quickly realized that my computer was not nearly powerful 
            enough to run it. As such, I pivoted to use a smaller network as a proof 
            of concept, <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/lightweight-gan">lightweightGAN</a>.

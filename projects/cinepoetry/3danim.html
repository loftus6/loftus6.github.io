Of my three poems, this is the most literal and autobiographic. At the beginning of this semester, my partner’s Nana passed away. I accompanied my partner to this funeral, as my partner was in need of my support. It can be very strange to attend a funeral of someone you have never met before. I had a lot of empathy for everyone there, but it was impossible for me to personally be grieving at my partner’s loss. All I could do was offer my support the best I could. Complicating this was the anxiety of meeting my partner’s extended family for the first time. Leading up to the funeral, this was a major fear of mine, but unsurprisingly, it was not nearly as scary as my brain made it out to be. It was a wonderful service and in hindsight, all my worries seemed silly compared to the serious grief that everyone else had to contend with. At its core, this poem is about my struggle with anxiety, and how I had to fight against it to be the best partner I could be. As hard as it may be, I cannot allow anxiety to stop me from doing what I need to do in life. This remains an ongoing struggle in my life, but every now and then I need to take a step back and appreciate my improvement in managing these feelings.

Technically, this poem was by far my biggest endeavor. I am a hobbyist game developer, and as part of that I have experience in 3D modeling and texturing. With how directly this poem came from my lived experience, I wanted as much control over recreating the images as possible. As such, I decided to create an animation using the modeling software Blender and the game engine Unreal Engine 5. I modeled the church fully by myself and filled in the furniture using a combination of models I made in the past and CC0 models from the internet. The textures were all obtained from CC0 resources. Most of my time went into assembling the scene in Unreal Engine 5 and setting up the lighting and shaders in the way that I wanted. Unreal Engine 5 is primarily used for video games, but it is also commonly used for animation and VFX. For my animation, I wanted it to be video gamesque, particularly a late 90s early 2000s retro 3D game aesthetic. This was partially because I like the recent revival of the style for indie games and partially because it is easier to make look good than hyperrealism. In the end, I think I spent around 10 hours on the whole animation process. While that may seem like a bit of overkill, I enjoyed it a lot. It has inspired me to keep exploring these tools, whether it be for another video poem like this one, or an interactive video game. I struggled to put this poem down at times. Even now, I see tens of different things I could tweak and improve. But at some point it has to be done. I hope you have enjoyed these 3 poems and that you have a wonderful day.

		<p>
		Not once have I heard your voice <br>
		Nor sat down at the table with you <br>
		or even shaken your hand<br>
		yet I stand before your visage<br>
		amongst scores of mourners<br>
		each with stories to share<br>
		of good times and bad times<br>
		of how much they wished I could have met you.<br>
		</p>
			
		<p>
		I slink through empty church halls<br>
		dodging through crowds of unfamiliar faces<br>
		trying to find the seldom few I can anchor myself to.<br>
		I keep searching and searching for the correct feeling,<br>
		studying the lines and creases of your face<br>
		so I may don the correct mask<br>
		to make you feel at peace.<br>

		</p>
			
		<p>
		I don a robe of solemnity <br>
		to be the pillar of support you need<br>
		amidst a bubbling sea of anxiety<br>
		whose waves corrode and abrade my base<br>
		challenging me to not crumple into dust.<br>
		</p>
			
		<p>
		I cannot claim to know you <br>
		I know not your up or downs <br>
		nor can I muster tears to fall. <br>
		Yet, I see on each face in this room <br>
		hearts touched by your life and death <br>
		and for them <br>
		I pay my respects. <br>

		</p>

Of the three poems, this was certainly the one I was most tentative about, as I did not want it to come off as too negative. Something I have struggled with for some time are worries that my close friends do not like. In some of these cases, I feel as though I put a lot of effort into trying to get people to like me, even at the expense of myself. Particularly, I have found myself changing facets of my personality to be more likable, which inevitably led me to a lot of stress and even the dissolution of these friendships. When writing this poem, I did not want to give the impression that I was blaming anyone else for my problems, truthfully this was a problem I created for myself. Rather, I wanted to reflect on how I caused myself discomfort for the sake of being more liked. I have since learned that it is okay to just be on good terms with people, I don’t need to go out of my way to be likable to anyone in particular, and if I am my genuine self, things will work out fine naturally. While in hindsight this may seem obvious, there are just some things in life that have to be learned the hard way.

		I had a similar experience about a year ago, while I was at a fundraising dinner for my elementary school. As I wandered the empty halls, I felt a strange mix of emotions as I looked at the child sized chairs and lockers. While I was sad to go back to this place of my childhood and not see any familiar faces, I couldn’t help but smile at the scholastic book fair still being there. This memory inspired me to write this cinepoem, substituting in an abandoned mall and train tunnels for the empty school. My first drafts of this poem were far more glum, but I eventually arrived on a positive conclusion: reminiscing can sometimes be bittersweet, but the happy memories still bring me joy, even though they have long since passed.

On a technical level, I learned a lot during the production of this poem. My main goal was to experiment with live music. I play mandolin as a hobby, and for this poem, I decided to strum a bit on my mandola (which is to a mandolin as a viola is to a violin). I didn’t score anything, rather I just played a few scales and jumped around notes when it felt right. I tried to change up the tone to fit the mood of the stanzas. I made a few mistakes during the recording, but due to the staticness of the shot, it wasn’t too difficult to cut out the more awkward parts of the performance. One of the largest challenges I faced was dealing with the ambient background noise. I recorded this near a highway, which caused a lot of very loud car noises to get picked up. I was able to reduce this, but as a consequence, the audio sounds a little unnatural due to the noise removal filter. Fortunately, this did not remove the insect noises, which I wanted to keep in recording. This was the only poem that I recorded footage for. I quickly realized that I had a few problems with my setup, such as setting up my phone as a camera without having it tilt. If I were to re-record this poem, which sadly I could not do for a while due to the change of seasons, I would look at getting some better equipment to get a better image. Despite these complaints, I still believe this poem turned out well. While I do prefer my other two poems, I still had fun with this one and learned a lot about video production.

		When the time had come to uproot myself, <br>
		I settled upon a beautiful bed,<br>
		where the sunflowers grew splendid<br>
		</p>
			
		<p>
		I adored how they grew, <br>
		fearlessly and bright as day,<br>
		if only I could reach for the skies as they did.<br>
		</p>
			
		<p>
		I reached and stretched and strained <br>
		trying to become as tall as them,<br>
		until finally I had touched the skies.<br>
		</p>
			
		<p>
		Yet, I could not blossom. <br>
		My leaves withered and my body splayed,<br>
		as the flowers marched higher in my absence.<br>
		</p>
			
		<p>
		I remained there for a season <br>
		consigned to the dirt and the muck,<br>
		until the time had come to uproot myself.<br>
		</p>
			
		<p>
		I settled upon a wild and rusty greenhouse <br>
		where the vines grew low and tangled<br>
		hidden from the sun in all its glory.<br>
		</p>
			
		<p>
		and in that strange and abandoned garden <br>
		despite its bristly facade<br>
		I thrived unfettered.<br>

		A few years back, the big viral craze of the week was something called “the Backrooms”. This image of a dingy storage room had taken on a new life as an internet horror story, detailing how one could fall between the cracks in reality and either be lost forever or be preyed upon by some horrifying monster, depending on the storyteller. While this story is fun and all, I am more interested in the larger visual trend it was a part of: “liminal spaces”. These are spaces or images of spaces that evoke a feeling of deja vu somewhere in your brain, even if you had never been there.

		While this does allow for some spooky storytelling about possible supernatural reasons, in all likelihood, you are simply recognizing common elements in the image to other places you have visited. I imagine what is and isn’t a liminal space can vary based on the person, with age and culture influencing what familiar memories you are pulling from. What I have noticed amongst Americans around my age online is that shopping malls are a very common source of this feeling. Particularly with the Covid pandemic, I saw many people online entranced with abandoned malls. A certain melancholy pervades these discussions, as people juxtapose how lively malls were in their youth as compared to now.

		I had a similar experience about a year ago, while I was at a fundraising dinner for my elementary school. As I wandered the empty halls, I felt a strange mix of emotions as I looked at the child sized chairs and lockers. While I was sad to go back to this place of my childhood and not see any familiar faces, I couldn’t help but smile at the scholastic book fair still being there. This memory inspired me to write this cinepoem, substituting in an abandoned mall and train tunnels for the empty school. My first drafts of this poem were far more glum, but I eventually arrived on a positive conclusion: reminiscing can sometimes be bittersweet, but the happy memories still bring me joy, even though they have long since passed.

		Beyond the text itself, the technical production was quite interesting. This was my first work in a while, so it took some time to relearn the ropes and make it come together smoothly. The biggest adjustment was getting used to working with found footage. I started with gathering images that interested me and then I decided on the theme. As such, I had a number of sources that I completely left on the cutting room floor, as I couldn’t see how to fit them in. On the opposite end of the spectrum, after I had written my text, for certain stanzas I had a particular image I wanted in my brain, but couldn’t quite find an image that felt exactly correct. While I did enjoy this type of video production, I definitely wanted more control at times, which led to me choosing the medium of animation for my final cinepoem of the year.

		<i>
		<p>
		The mind is a cruel and fickle beast, <br>
hidden in it’s jungle of synapses and neurons is a thief,<br>
who so immutably and elusively<br>
pilfers my barest and most untarnished memories<br>
lacquering on the rust and grime of wisdom<br>
as I trespass back through the sites of my youthful exuberance.<br>
		</p>

<p>
These once familiar halls now bear their hostility in every facet,<br>
with their miniature chairs and their antiquated lockers<br>
mocking me for my extended absence.<br>
Walls that once filled me with such curiosity and mirth<br>
now hum silently with lonely fluorescence.<br>
		</p>


		<p>
Yet laugher holds not solitary devotion,<br>
though familiar voices long since reverberate.<br>
For each sigh I speak is echoed by a song in each ear,<br>
as from a heavenly choir with myriad singers, known and unknown,<br>
piercing through the haze of my sullen mind.<br>
		</p>


		<p>
As sure as the thief will claim more victims, <br>
my joy will shine through,<br>
whether it’s cleansing waves radiate directly upon me,<br>
or bounces circuitously through the cathedrals of my doubt.<br>
Even if they pass through interference and foam prisons of my own creation<br>
to find they fall upon deaf ears,<br>
they will march on undamped.<br>
		</p>

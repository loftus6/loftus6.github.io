		<h2>Commentary</h2>

		A few years back, the big viral craze of the week was something called “the Backrooms”. This image of a dingy storage room had taken on a new life as an internet horror story, detailing how one could fall between the cracks in reality and either be lost forever or be preyed upon by some horrifying monster, depending on the storyteller. While this story is fun and all, I am more interested in the larger visual trend it was a part of: “liminal spaces”. These are spaces or images of spaces that evoke a feeling of deja vu somewhere in your brain, even if you had never been there.

		While this does allow for some spooky storytelling about possible supernatural reasons, in all likelihood, you are simply recognizing common elements in the image to other places you have visited. I imagine what is and isn’t a liminal space can vary based on the person, with age and culture influencing what familiar memories you are pulling from. What I have noticed amongst Americans around my age online is that shopping malls are a very common source of this feeling. Particularly with the Covid pandemic, I saw many people online entranced with abandoned malls. A certain melancholy pervades these discussions, as people juxtapose how lively malls were in their youth as compared to now.

		I had a similar experience about a year ago, while I was at a fundraising dinner for my elementary school. As I wandered the empty halls, I felt a strange mix of emotions as I looked at the child sized chairs and lockers. While I was sad to go back to this place of my childhood and not see any familiar faces, I couldn’t help but smile at the scholastic book fair still being there. This memory inspired me to write this cinepoem, substituting in an abandoned mall and train tunnels for the empty school. My first drafts of this poem were far more glum, but I eventually arrived on a positive conclusion: reminiscing can sometimes be bittersweet, but the happy memories still bring me joy, even though they have long since passed.

		Beyond the text itself, the technical production was quite interesting. This was my first work in a while, so it took some time to relearn the ropes and make it come together smoothly. The biggest adjustment was getting used to working with found footage. I started with gathering images that interested me and then I decided on the theme. As such, I had a number of sources that I completely left on the cutting room floor, as I couldn’t see how to fit them in. On the opposite end of the spectrum, after I had written my text, for certain stanzas I had a particular image I wanted in my brain, but couldn’t quite find an image that felt exactly correct. While I did enjoy this type of video production, I definitely wanted more control at times, which led to me choosing the medium of animation for my final cinepoem of the year.
